# Hexerator
Versatile GUI hex editor focused on binary file exploration and aiding pattern recognition. Written in Rust.

Check out [the Hexerator book](https://crumblingstatue.github.io/hexerator-book/) for a detailed list of features, and more!

## Note for contributors:
Hexerator only supports latest nightly Rust.
You need an up-to-date nightly to build Hexerator.

Hexerator doesn't shy away from experimenting with unstable Rust features.
Contributors can use any nightly feature they wish.

Contributors however are free to rewrite code to use stable features if it doesn't result in:

- A loss of features
- Reduced performance
- Significantly worse maintainability
